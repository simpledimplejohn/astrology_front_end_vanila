I want to do some web design and css
Here's the front end page layout

Front page
index.html
<!-- 
This will be the front page of the website.  Which will alow users to input their information and get their star chart, and be added to the database so we can run analytics on all that data.  The project is called The Astrology Interface.  And will work with a backend server at http://localhost:3000/

For this example I want just the webpage html and css, as well as a list of any pictures or icons I will need to get.

I want this done as if it was a vintage 1970's green and black computer interface.  With each of the components seperated by dashed lines, and a vintage computer type font
